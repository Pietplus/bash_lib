set -eux +o pipefail
**********************


The line set -eux +o pipefail is used in Bash scripts to enable certain options that affect the behavior and error handling of the script. Let's break down what each part of this line does:

set -e: This option, also known as errexit, causes the script to exit immediately if any command in the script returns a non-zero exit status. It helps in ensuring that the script stops execution as soon as an error occurs.
set -u: This option, also known as nounset, treats unset variables as an error and causes the script to exit. It helps in avoiding the usage of undefined variables, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
set -x: This option, also known as xtrace or debug, enables verbose mode and prints each command before executing it. It helps in debugging the script by providing detailed

information about the execution flow.
+o pipefail: This option sets the pipefail option to its default value. The pipefail option ensures that the exit status of a pipeline of commands is the value of the rightmost (last executed) command that exited with a non-zero status. This is helpful when using pipes (|) to chain commands, as it allows capturing failures within the pipeline.
By including this line at the beginning of a Bash script, you enable these options to enhance error handling, debug the script, and capture failures in command pipelines.

It's important to note that while these options can be useful for development and debugging, they may not always be suitable for production scripts or certain scenarios. It's recommended to evaluate their usage based on the specific requirements of your script and the potential impact on its behavior.
